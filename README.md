# School_District_Analysis

### Project Overview

The purpose of this project was to perform entry level analyitics using a dataframe of student information spanning a single school district.

### Analysis & Conclusion

The first steps involved simply importing pandas and creating the path to import the appropriate csv file. After this I checked if the data could be displayed correctly and then began to drop NaN values and duplicate rows from the dataset. The grade column was also altered by dropping the "th" at the end of each value and then changing the column type to int64. From here I played with the data using a variety of functions, including describe, loc, iloc, mean, groupby, and sortby. This was done in an effort to identify different data measuremnts within the dataframe. All in all, pandas serves to be a powerful tool in data anaylsis.
